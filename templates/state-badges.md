## No Project State Badge found in your readme!
Hello! I scanned your readme and could not find a project state badge. A project state badge will provide contributors to your project as well as other stakeholders (platform services, executive) insight into the lifecycle of your repository.
## What is a Project State Badge?
It is a simple image that neatly describes your project's stage in its lifecycle. More information can be found in the [project state badges documentation](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie/blob/master/doc/state-badges.md).
## What do I need to do?
I suggest you make a PR into your README.md and add a project state badge near the top where it is easy for your users to pick it up :). Once it is merged feel free to close this issue. I will not open up a new one :)
