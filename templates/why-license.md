Repos in our organization need to be licensed appropriately; you'll need to decide how to licence different components of your project based on what the contents are. Here is the _TL;DR_ version:

1. Source code created by the BCGov should be Apache (Apache-2.0);
2. Text created by the BCGov should be Creative Commons International 4.0 (CC BY);
3. Data created by the BCGov should be Open Government Licence - BC (OGL-BC).

For more information, or for out-of-the-box situations check out the [BC Policy Framework for GitHub][1].

Since most repos are code based I've added the Apache-2.0 license as part of this PR. Please checkout this branch and change the license as needed or merge if if you're happy with my suggestion.

### Pro Tip ðŸ¤“

- If you're not sure what to do **add a comment** with the the command **@rm help** in it; a real-live-person will reply back to help you out.

- Only license content BCGov creates. If it was created by someone else **you must** include the original license that work was released under.

### Commands ðŸ¤–

I can update the status of the PIA and STRA for you; **you'll** just need to merge the PR when I'm done. You can find the available `status` values in the table above. Below are some commands I understand:

| Command  | Description                                       |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| @rm help | You're freaking out and want to talk to a person. |

#### Examples

```console
@rm help
```
