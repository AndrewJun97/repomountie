@[USER_NAME] When a pull request (PR) is over the 200-400 line range (of change) the ability of the reviewer to effectively detect issues quickly diminishes. Your PR is over the preferred length of [MAX_LINES] lines set for this repo. While this cannot always be avoided, please be mindful of the reviewer's time by organizing your work into smaller, more manageable PRs.

Here are a few thoughtful articles on what a good PR should look like:

### Pro Tip

- Add the command `/bot-ignore-length` in the body (preferably as the last line) of a PR if you have a legitimate reason for lengthy PR.
