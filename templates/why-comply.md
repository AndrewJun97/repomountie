Projects in our organization (bcgov) need to complete a Privacy Assessment (PIA) and Security Threat & Risk Assessment (STRA) before they go live in production. Since every ministry has their own way of doing both the STRA and PIA we don't enforce that projects do them, only that they report on the current status.

To help with reporting, I've added a compliance audit file as part of this pull request. Please checkout this branch and edit update `state` as needed. Here is a table of possible states:

| State       | Description                                                                                            |
| ----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TBD         | If you're surprised by this news, use this state. I'll let you talk to your MISO and check back later. |
| in-progress | Use this state when your assessment(s) are underway.                                                   |
| completed   | Use this state when your assessment(s) are completed. ðŸ™Œ ðŸŽ‰                                            |
| exempt      | The PIA or STRA isn't applicable to your project / repo.                                               |

Here is what a completed audit file might look like:

```yaml
name: compliance
description: |
  This document is used to track a projects PIA and STRA
  compliance.
spec:
  - name: PIA
    status: in-progress
    last-updated: '2019-11-22T00:03:52.138Z'
  - name: STRA
    status: completed
    last-updated: '2019-11-22T00:03:52.138Z'
```
