Its often hard for people to acknowledge that some things are just not that important and, unfortunately, some issues will never get done - like this issue for example; Its been stagnant for [MAX_DAYS_OLD] days. For me, being a robot, I'm happy to face the facts and, as a result, I'm closing this issue.

### Pro Tip

- If you're sad and want to re-open this issue you'll have another [MAX_DAYS_OLD] days to address it.

- Or, if you want me to ignore this issue and never close it again, add the label "neverstale".
