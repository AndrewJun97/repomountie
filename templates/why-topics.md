# TL;DR

Topics greatly improve the discoverability of repos; please add the short code from the table below to the topic(s) of your repo so that ministries can use GitHub's search to find out what repos belong to them and other visitors can find useful content.

### Why Topic

In short order we'll add our 800th repo. This large number clearly demonstrates the success of using GitHub and our Open Source initiative. This huge success means its critical that we work to make our content as discoverable as possible. Through discoverability, we promote code reuse across a large decentralized organization like the Government of British Columbia.

### What to do

Below is a table of abbreviation a.k.a short codes for each ministry; they're the ones used in all `@gov.bc.ca` email addresses. Please add the short codes of the ministry that "owns" **this** repo as a `topic`:

1. Go to the main page of your repo;
2. In the upper-left you'll see a `mange topics` link (click or touch it);
3. Type in the matching short code from the table below.

That's in, you're done!!!

### Pro Tip ðŸ¤“

- If your org is **not** in the list below, or the table contains errors, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie).

- While you're doing this, add additional `topics` that would help someone searching for "something". These can be the language used `javascript` or `R`; something like `opendata` or `data` for data only repos; or any other key words that are useful. 

- Add a meaningful description to your repo. This is hugely valuable to people looking through our repositories.

- If your application is live, add the production URL.
