		"body": "Repos in our organization need to be licensed appropriately; you'll need to decide how to licence different components of your project based on what the contents are. Here is the _TL;DR_ version:\n\n1. Source code created by the BCGov should be Apache (Apache-2.0);\n2. Text created by the BCGov should be Creative Commons International 4.0 (CC BY);\n3. Data created by the BCGov should be Open Government Licence - BC (OGL-BC).\n\nFor more information, or for out-of-the-box situations check out the [BC Policy Framework for GitHub][1].\n\nSince most repos are code based I've added the Apache-2.0 license as part of this PR. Please checkout this branch and change the license as needed or merge if if you're happy with my suggestion.\n\n### Pro Tip 🤓\n\n- If you're not sure what to do **add a comment** with the the command **@repo-mountie help** in it; a real-live-person will reply back to help you out.\n\n- Only license content BCGov creates. If it was created by someone else **you must** include the original license that work was released under.\n\n### Commands 🤖\n\nI can update the status of the PIA and STRA for you; **you'll** just need to merge the PR when I'm done. You can find the available `status` values in the table above. Below are some commands I understand:\n\n| Command            | Description                                       |\n| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |\n| @repo-mountie help | You're freaking out and want to talk to a person. |\n\n#### Examples\n\n```console\n@repo-mountie help\n```\n\n[1]: https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/tree/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide\n",

		"body": "## TL;DR 🏎️\n\nYour repo is missing a compliance audit file so I've created this PR with a **template** that you can update with the correct PIA and STRA status (status options in the table below). If you'd like me to do this for you, skip to the _commands_ section below.\n\n## Compliance\n\nProjects in our organization (bcgov) need to complete a [Privacy Impact Assessment][2] (PIA) and Security Threat & Risk Assessment (STRA) before they go live in production. Since every ministry has their own way of doing both the STRA and PIA we don't enforce that projects do them, only that they report on the current status.\n\nTo help with reporting, I've added a compliance audit file as part of this pull request. Please checkout this branch and edit update `status` as needed. Here is a table of possible states:\n\n| Status      | Description                                                                                            |\n| ----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| TBD         | If you're surprised by this news, use this state. I'll let you talk to your MISO and check back later. |\n| in-progress | Use this state when your assessment(s) are underway.                                                   |\n| completed   | Use this state when your assessment(s) are completed. 🙌 🎉                                            |\n| exempt      | The PIA or STRA isn't applicable to your project / repo.                                               |\n\nHere is what a completed audit file might look like:\n\n```yaml\nname: compliance\ndescription: |\n  This document is used to track a projects PIA and STRA\n  compliance.\nspec:\n  - name: PIA\n    status: in-progress\n    last-updated: '2019-11-22T00:03:52.138Z'\n  - name: STRA\n    status: completed\n    last-updated: '2019-11-22T00:03:52.138Z'\n```\n\nFor more information check out the [BC Policy Framework for GitHub][1].\n\n### Pro Tip 🤓\n\n- If you're not sure what to do **add a comment below** with the command **@repo-mountie help** in it; a real-live-person will reply back to help you out.\n- Leverage this PR to document the history of your PIA and STRA thus far by adding a comment or two.\n\n### Commands 🤖\n\nI can update the status of the PIA and STRA for you; **you'll** just need to merge the PR when I'm done. You can find the available `status` values in the table above. Below are some commands I understand:\n\n| Command                          | Description                                       |\n| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |\n| @repo-mountie help               | You're freaking out and want to talk to a person. |\n| @repo-mountie update-pia STATUS  | You want me to update the PIA status.             |\n| @repo-mountie update-stra STATUS | You want me to update the STRA status.            |\n\n#### Examples\n\n```console\n@repo-mountie update-pia completed\n@repo-mountie update-stra in-progress\n```\n\n[1]: https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/tree/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide\n[2]: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy/privacy-impact-assessments\n",
