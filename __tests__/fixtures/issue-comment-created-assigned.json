Here is the _TL;DR_ version:\n\n1. Source code should be Apache (Apache-2.0);\n2. Text should be Creative Commons International 4.0 (CC BY);\n3. Data created by the BC Gov should be Open Government Licence - BC (OGL-BC).\n\nFor more information, or for out-of-the-box situations check out the [BC Policy Framework for GitHub][1].\n\nSince most repos are code based I've added the Apache-2.0 license as part of this PR. If you're not sure what to do **add a comment below**; a real-live-person will reply back and we can use this PR to document our conversation and help you get the best licence for your project.\n\n###Pro Tip\nAdd a comment with the word **help** in it and I'll assing an expert to help you out.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/tree/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide\n"
